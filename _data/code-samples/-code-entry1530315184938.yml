  Unload cargo from unit - requires the name of the port/unit with the cargo as
  well as the dbid of the cargo you want to unload - and the qty of that unit.
  So rather than the cargo all unloading into one unit you can control how many
  get stuck together. The unit unloaded gets a generic name like Mech Inf #100
  which seems to go in sequence.

  ScenEdit_UnloadCargo('Port of Grand Cayman', { {2,2380}}) -- unloads 2 units
  of dbid 2380 (mech inf)
