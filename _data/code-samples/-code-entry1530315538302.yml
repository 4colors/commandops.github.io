  Set a units course, assumes you know the unit name or guid. This example is
  for a land unit but I think it would work for a ship or maybe ac if they were
  airborne? First it gets the current location, and uses that as one end of the
  course to be set.
code: "local a =ScenEdit_GetUnit({ unitname='Mech Inf #105'}) \r\na.course = {{ lat =a.latitude, lon=a.longitude}, {lat=19.3874718855336, lon=-81.3869183989322} } \r\nprint (a.course)"
