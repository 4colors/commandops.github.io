  Change current fuel on a unit to a random value around 60-80% of max fuel for
  that unit. Each unit has a type of fuel for itself, and sometimes other types
  of fuel for units it hosts. You have to match the correct type of fuel. This
  example is for an aircraft, with only one type (AviationFuel) which is type
  2001. The fuel object will tell you max fuel and current fuel, you'll want to
  change current fuel.
code: "local a = ScenEdit_GetUnit({guid='1298e86b-a6a8-4bb0-bf94-dd77c6559eaa'})\r\nlocal fuel = a.fuel\r\nprint(fuel) --before change\r\nfuel[2001].current = fuel[2001].max*math.random(600, 800)/1000\r\na.fuel = fuel\r\nprint(fuel) --after change"
