  Exception: [string "ScenLoadOverlays"]:1: unexpected symbol near char(145)  -
  of you see something like this where you copied code from somewhere it is
  possible the Quote mark is an illegal character - it is very hard to see, but
  some quotes are curly and these are not actual quotes as far as lua is
  concerned.
code: "ScenEdit_UseAttachment('76856ec9-d23c-4a1c-baf7-599afdf7054a')  --good quotes\r\n\r\nScenEdit_UseAttachment(‘5083bee2-7d99-4e40-a17c-29dd97e75f07’) --bad curly quotes but very hard to tell"
