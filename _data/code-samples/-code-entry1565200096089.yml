  Get units from a particular mission and change their speed. For instance to
  stop manpads so they can actually shoot. Probably need to turn their speed on
  and off at an interval, otherwise they never stop and can never shoot.
code: "local m = ScenEdit_GetMission ('Blue', 'Manpads')\r\nprint(#m.unitlist)\r\n\r\nfor i =1,#m.unitlist do\r\nlocal u = SE_GetUnit({guid=m.unitlist[i]})\r\nu.manualSpeed=0\r\nend --loop"
