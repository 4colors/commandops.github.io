Hi, my name is Ron aka Whicker. I created this site to help with writing scenarios for the game Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations (CMANO).

By day I run a  [photo lab in San Diego](https://prolabprints.com) where I have learned a fair amount about web stuff - especially the [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) that this site was built with - and of course [https://github.com](https://github.com) where this site is hosted.

All of the code for this site can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/commandops/commandops.github.io), if you would like to add anything to this feel free to do a pull request, I'd love to have others contribute. Feel free to fork it and build your own version of this as well - especially if I am no longer maintaining it.

Huge credit to georgehedfors.github.io for making the original web based inst tool - his code was not working (I think the API changed) and no one had heard from him so I figured it would be ok if I copied his code and resurrected it here.
